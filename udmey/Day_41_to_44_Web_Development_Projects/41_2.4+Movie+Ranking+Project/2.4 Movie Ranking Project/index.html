<h1>Best Movie According to Sharad</h1>

<h2>My top three movies for all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirit of the Beehive</h3>
<p>For the children, the movie had might as well only be about
     the monster, so tellingly performed by Boris Karloff. 
     The creature comes upon a farmer’s young daughter tossing 
     flowers into a pond to watch them float. Perhaps because of 
     censorship, the film cuts directly from this to the monster 
     mournfully carrying the child’s drowned body through the village. 
     Perhaps because of censorship, we don’t see that he did not drown
      her, but threw her in with delight, thinking she would float 
      as well. For the two girls, 
    especially Ana (Ana Torrent), this makes a dramatic impression.</p>


<h3>Monsieur Hire</h3>
<p>Patrice Leconte's "Monsieur Hire" is a tragedy about loneliness 
    and erotomania, told about two solitary people who have nothing 
    else in common. It involves a murder, and the opening shot is of
     a corpse. Monsieur Hire is a scrawny, balding middle-aged tailor
      who lives by himself. Alice is a beautiful, tender-hearted 
      22-year-old blonde who lives alone across the courtyard from 
      Hire in the same apartment building.On the night of the murder, 
      a slight man was seen by witnesses running toward the building. 
      In his investigation among its residents, a police detective 
      learns that nobody likes Hire. Hire is the first to agree.
       He admits he seems to strike people oddly. As a neighbor 
       from across the hall peeks at him from his doorway, he asks,
        "Want a photo?" As he walks through his courtyard, white powder 
        is dumped on his impeccable black suit.</p>

        <h3>Departures</h3>
        <p>It is a bad time for the young couple. 
            He plays the cello in a small provincial orchestra. 
            Their audiences have been sparse. The owner of the 
            orchestra sadly tells them it must shut down. He comes
             home and informs his wife. There is more bad news. 
             He recently purchased a new cello, paying far more than 
             they could afford. He didn't tell her because he knew 
             she would say it was a bad idea. Now she knows.</p>
