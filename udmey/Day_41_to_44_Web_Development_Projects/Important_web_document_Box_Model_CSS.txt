THE BOX MODEL :-
  Margin,Padding and Border

we can increase the box size as pixel or percentage
we can make border :10px         solid    black
                    ---------------------------
                    thickness    style    color
            border-top:0px;
            this will make the top of box with no border
            border-width : 0px 10px 20px 30px (goes clockwise in box)              

Padding - it is adding space betweeen border and content in box
