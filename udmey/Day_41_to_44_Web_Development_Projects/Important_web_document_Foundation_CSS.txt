-- 3 ways to adding CSS to HTMl
   -- INLINE
      <tag style="css"/>
      -- Same line as a particular element
                      --property--value--  
      e.g <html style="background:blue">
          </html>      ----value------
   
     -- only used in one line element, normally not used too much as for each element we need to define it every time. useful for testing    


   -- INTERNAL
      <style>css</style>
      <html>
          <head>
              <style>
                  html{                 -- selector, before curley braces
                      background:red;
                     }
              </style>
           </head>
        </html>   
       
   -- in internal styles, if we are having multipage requirement then 
   -- best option is external as internal starts and ends in <html> </html>
   -- that for single page.





   -- EXTERNAL
     <link href="style.css"/>
    -- External style sheet is defined externally and used in Html tag
      
      <html>
          <head>
              <link
                  html{
                      rel="stylesheet"  -- relationship (role of sheet)
                      href="/style.css" -- location of style sheet
                />
           </head>
        </html>

       # we defined it externally in style.css and link in above <html>
       # so style.css can be used in in multiple <html> tags i.e. pages
       style.css 
            html{
                background:green;
               }

   INLINE   - when to target single element
   INTERNAL - when we are targeting single page
   EXTERNAL - when using external style sheet and can used in multiple webpages 
              pages in 
entire website
            - mostly used in CSS styling


-- CSS SELECTOR
    - can create CSS rule using color:blue  i.e. property:value . this is what we discussed above.

Element Selector :-
   h1{
       color:blue
    }
 Above applies to all elelents whi has got h1 tag

 e.g. :-
     index.html

     <h2>Red</h2>
     <h2>Green</h2>
     <h2>Blue</h2>

      style.css
           h2{
              color:red;
             }
    so above even in index.html we have got different color but using style.css
    will chnage all h2 tags to RED in index.html


   .red-heading{
        color:red
    }

   Class is to grouping elements, below example is having class red-text

     <h2 class ="red-text">Red</h2>          -- will be red
     <h2>Green</h2>                          -- will be green  
     <p>class ="red-text">Paragraph</p>      -- will be red

      .red-text{
              color:red;
             }
  

ID SELECTOR:-
  
  #main{
     color:red
   }

 same as class but difference is class selector can be applied to mutiple
 element where main can be applied to single element in single html file.
 Benefit is where class is same for all h2 elelents but by giving main
to one h2 element it will behave different to generically deinfed class
id's are unique class can be given to many elements


  e.g :-
     <h2 id ="main">Red</h2>          -- will be red
     <h2>Green</h2>                   -- will be green  
     <h2>Blue</h2>                   -- will be blue


  #main{
     color:red
   }


ATTRIBUTE SELCTOR :-
   p[draggable]{
          color:red   
    }
p is html element
draggablle is attribute
This means all paragraph elemenets to attribute draggable

<p draggable="true"> Drag me</p>  -- will be red
<p> Don't Drag me</p>             -- no color 
<p> Don't Drag me</p>             -- no color

Another way is 


<p draggable="true"> Drag me</p>                    -- will be with no color
<p draggable="false"> Don't Drag me</p>             -- red color as its false 
<p draggable="false"> Don't Drag me</p>             -- red color as its false


p[draggable="false"]{
          color:red   
    }

UNIVERSAL SELECTOR :-
    
     *{
        color:red
      }

 * - means select all , applies to all where style sheet is active.
