HOW INTERNET works :-

Client (i.e. our machine sends request to our ISP)
ISP (Internet service provider) which further looks for DNS (Domain Name System) 
DNS is like directory which looks for IP address we have given to search the site (for e.g www.google.com)
Every single computer has ip address and request is send on that IP address

we can got https://www.nslookup.io/ and type google.com to see the Ip address of google

we will get below :-

A records
IPv4 address				Revalidate in
Hosted by Google LLC  142.250.179.206	4m 8s

IP address may change if we access it later as its assign it different every time

Also we can goto https://www.submarinecablemap.com/ to check how these interenet cables are conencted under sea, concssisting the 100s of fibre optics wires, transfmetting 400 giga byte (GB) of data per second.

HOW DO WEBSITE WORKS :-
       HTML,CSS and Javascript do exactly

       to access we internet we use browser (e or chrome)
       HTML is like structure of website. (like we create structure of house)
       we can create button,image or text box etc in HTML   
       CSS is like  stylistic to code , like paining and decorating. HOw we want it to look
       like we have got button through HTML but we want it to be red or text as blue
       JAVA script , is basically provide it behaviour (like electrician providing lights in house or plumbing)
       actually how page will behave.

Installed Visual Studio
and installed plugins :-
      - Live Preview
      - Prettier
      - vscode-icons

Installed Chrome 


HTML :- is for contenet and strcuture for file. (hyper text markup language) 
         Mark ups we do by html tags like italic, heading or body etc
 
<h1> Hello World </h1>

 h1 and /h1 are opening and closing tags
 <h1> Hello World </h1> - complete is called element
<h1> Hello World </h1> 
<h2> Hello World </h2> 
<h3> Hello World </h3> 
<h4> Hello World </h4> 
<h5> Hello World </h5>
<h6> Hello World </h6> 

There is no Html tag h7 .. html tags are uptill h6 i.e from h1- h6

Its not good practice to have more than one h1. as its the top most
if need another level of heading go for h2 onward
Dont' skip levels like afetr h1 moved to h3 this is not right. from h1 move to h2.
This will not break the website a we have to make it good practice so be in sequence

PARAGRAPH element :-
-----------------
<p> This is a paragraph </p>
it seperates lines under tags and make it paragraph.

lipsum.com
baconipsum.com
broipsum.com
funny lorem ipsum


VOID elements :-
Header and paragraph are NON - VOID elements as they have got content in it
e.g. <p> This is a paragraph.</p>

Void elements where we are forbidden to put any content inside the tag
e.g. <hr />  horizontal rule

<p> This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr />
<p> This is a paragraph.</p>


output :-

<p> This is a paragraph.</p>
____________________________

<p> This is a paragraph.</p>


break element <br /> :-
break element is to seperate line in between paragraph like in poems etc. In same
paragraph but diffrent line

<p> This is a paragraph. <br />
 This is a paragraph.</p>

-- To check the difference do diffchecker.com

we can write <hr /> or <hr>
             <br /> or <br>
but its always good to write it with forward slash so thta we can know. its void element not tags so better to use like <hr />

HTML BOILER Plate :-
-----------------

<!DOCTYPE html> -- tells which version of file latest version is 5
<html lang= "en"> -- language of text content and content will be between
                     this and below closing tag
   <head> 
      <meta charset="UTF-8"> -- not visible to user , we define character set
      <title> -- what title should be dsiaplayed for website e.g. google 
   </head> 

   <body>
     content of website
     e.g. <h1> Hello world! </h1>
   </body>

</html>

-- Indent the code properly to make it understand
-- In VS code ! and heading enter for the first selection this will create the header 
   by itself . this works when we have created the website before with .html extension


LIST ELEMENTS:-
   order or unordered list

    unordered list (ul , gives bullet points):-
         <ul> 
          <li>MIlk </li>  -- list item
          <li>Eggs </li>  -- list item   
          <li>Flour </li>  -- list item
         </ul>

   output :- ( no order is define)
         . Milk
         . Eggs
         . Flour

   ordered list (ol, gives numbering to list items):-
         <ol> 
          <li>MIlk </li>  -- list item
          <li>Eggs </li>  -- list item   
          <li>Flour </li>  -- list item
         </ol>
   
    output :- (order is define)
         1. Milk
         2. Eggs
         3. Flour


Nesting and indentation :-
 -- <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
        <ul> </ul>
    <li> </li>   

ANCHOR ELEMENTS :- ( Allows us to create Hyperlink)

<a> This is a link </a>
To put Hyper link in above statement we need hyper link in <a> with href="<link>"
i.e.
 <a href="http://www.google.com"> This is a link </a>
<tag attribute = value> Content </tag>
- we can have more than one attribute =Value in tag


example to starting list from 5 instead of 1 which is by default
answer is use start attribute in ol tag <ol  start = 5>

<h1>My top 2 Favourite Websites</h1>
<!-- Write your code below -->
<ol  start = 5>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/""> This is google link </a>
  </li> 
  <li>
   <a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/""> This is RightMove link </a>
  </li> 
</ol>


IMAGE ELEMENTS :- Adding image to website
<img src="url" />  -- tells what is the source of image
NOTE :- there is in </img> closing tag its just />
img tag dosent have text element so img tag has src with backslash 

#https://picsum.photos/2000 give random picture just as place holder 2000 is size of photo

<img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="forest at sunset"/>

alt --> alt is alternate text description , for accessibilty for visual imapred users
