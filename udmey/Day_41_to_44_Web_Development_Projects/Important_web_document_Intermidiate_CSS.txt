COLOR PROPERTIES :-

Below is for whole html so will be whole page and its background-color
so background will be red

html{
   background-color:red
}


for h1 it's text color will be red
h1{
   color:blue
}

colorHunt.co (free tool with color pallets)
where each color has color hexcode

h1{
 color:#5D3891
}

FONT PROPERTIES:-

h1{
  color:blue
  font-weight:bold               
  font-size:20px                 --using pixel size
  font-family:sans-serif         -- 
}

.26mm (wide and tall) = 1/96th inch = 1px
instead of pixels we can use points as well
1px - pixels
1pt - points

.35mm = 1/72 of inch = 1pt (pt we use in word to describe font size of line)

1em = lenght of m thus called m instead of em.
      so if body has 20px then 1 em will be 20px where ever we defined
                          thne 2 em will be 40px where ever we defined

     i.e works according to the parent size
1rem  - is the scaled size of root . this means it changes when root tags chnages i.e. <html> size changes.

example below for em and rem :-

<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Colors</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: antiquewhite;
    }

    h1 {
      color: whitesmoke;
      background-color: darkseagreen;
    }

    h2 {
      color: #FAF8F1;
      background-color: #C58940;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <h2>World</h2>
</body>

</html>

for em we change the parent tag <body> and em chnages accordingly
for rem we change the root tag i.e. <html> and rem changes accordingly

its easy to keep track of rem as its is as per root level changes
but with em if change the parent which can be mutltiple this can confuse
which em is related to which parent.


Font weight :-
  normal bold           -- keywords
  Lighter Bolder        -- Relative to parent lighter in -100 bolder in +100
  Number                -- 100-900


TEXT ALIGNMENT:-
   
h1{
   text-align:center  --or left or right
  }

also got start (like starting from left to right /right to left)and end
