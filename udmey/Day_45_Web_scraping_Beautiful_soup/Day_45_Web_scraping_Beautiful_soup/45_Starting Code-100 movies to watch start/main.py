## Writing list into file
## in tutorial not sure encoding="utf-8" was missing which i added to make it work in code
with  open("Best_100_movie_list_file.txt",mode="w", encoding="utf-8") as fp:
        for movie in movie_list:
            fp.write(f"{movie}\n")
            
        print("Done !! . File Created")
