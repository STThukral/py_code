In this chapter we will be learning about command line, Web decorators and web development with flask (popular framework for creating website using python)

We have already learnet to create website using HTML and CSS but that is just still infoamtion .With this we will learn the backend part as where calculations are done at beackend using python.

We have heared about Full Stack for web development , which means

FULL STACK = FRONT END  + BACK END

FRONT END :- HTML (for structure) , CSS (for style) and JAVA SCRIPT (it gives it some interactivty)
BACK  END :- it can be JAVA SCRIPT, JAVA, PYTHON or RUBY

In addition to languages there are different Framwork to work FRONT and  BACKEND
e.g :- Angular and react for frontend

        node and Flask or jango for backend

SO the above FRAMEWORK has got lots tools and functionality already built in when we are creating front end
or Backend.

IN this we are using Python as backend and we can choose whole bunch of framworks like Flask , jango , cherrypie and pyramid. MOst popular one are Flask (for small projects)and Django (for larger and commercial projects).

Backend - Client + Server + Database ( they determine how backend will work)

Client - User going for browser 
Server - to receive request
Database - Storing information related to website


We will be using Flask to develope website , below link will help to learn flask quickly :-
