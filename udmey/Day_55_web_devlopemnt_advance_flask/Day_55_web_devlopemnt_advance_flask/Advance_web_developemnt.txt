Advance Decorator where we can pass inputs as positional and keyword argument
Rendering HTMl how we render the HTML we serve using flask
Parsing URL where we will be getting the URL passsed by users 

Flask accepts html in return cluase which is called HTML rendering
e.g return "<h1>Hello, World! Dave and Dad's Flask coding</h1>"

@app.route("/")          # to show home page called python decorator 
def hello_world():
    return "<h1>Hello, World! Dave and Dad's Flask coding</h1>"
